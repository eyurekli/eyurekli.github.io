        <p>If you found this webpage, you probably found it from my GitHub.</p>
        <p>This static page is a work in progress. To tell the truth, I am not actually going to develop *this* page further.</p>
        <p>I am currently in the process of learning React. With that, I want to create a personal website with dynamic content.</p>
        <p>Hopefully I can showcase a few projects too. One day, it will all come together.</p>
